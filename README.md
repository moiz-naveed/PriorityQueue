After typing "make" and using the make file to compile both the program and the test main,
bin/runMe <filename.txt> should execute the program.

Please make sure that in the text file, the format is "id priority code\n"

If a symptom code doesn't match, it'll just go through without taking up anytime

Simulation creates an output file with patient IDs and time stamps of treatment completed.

testmain should work with bin/testMe. No file is needed for the testmain although print and compare functions need to be defined for testmain.c
